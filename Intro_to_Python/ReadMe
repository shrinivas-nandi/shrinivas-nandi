Here is a bunch of scripts that I had written that are a great introduction to python. 
These were practice assignments from Prof Julian Mak's course @HKUST. 
Some of these like Penguins, ass1 and ass2 are the most important for actually learning how to write and plot data out in python. 
I personally find it a lot easier to work on python than R since its a lot more intuitive.
