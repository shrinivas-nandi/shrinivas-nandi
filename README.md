# Read me 

Hi there. My name is Shrinivas Nandi. A second year PhD student at the Bhattacharya lab. I utilize multi-omics tools to study symbiosis between organisms. My key focus is the study of coral-algal dysbiosis under thermal stress. More recently, I have also expanded to the study of Paulinella rhizaria.
