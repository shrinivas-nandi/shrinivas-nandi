Welcome to my Github page. My name is Shrinivas Nandi, currently a second year PhD student (2023) at the Bhattacharya lab at Rutgers University. I use multi-omics to study symbiosis across a number of species. Primarily this began by studying coral-algal symbiosis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Since then, I have proceeded to use bioinformatics to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind these organisms and their symbiosis. Furthermore, I have also expanded to studying the photosynthetic amoeba Paulinella chromtophora and the non-photosynthetic Paulinella ovalis 

Here I will be listing out a series of codes that I have used extensively at the Bhattacharya Lab at Rutgers University.
